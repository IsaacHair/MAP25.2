This set of programs is basically the next iteration from the programs in the main folder.

Note that I might not actually create this OS. I have already written a library with basic functions,
a program to render the mandelbrot set, and a program to render a spaceship with accurate gravity
and acceleration simulation.

I should probably actualy focus on writing an assembly programming language instead of using
bastardized c.
