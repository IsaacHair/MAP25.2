This file will just establish some dynamics and basic movement.
I am not expecting to get a full game; rather, this will establish
the needed graphics and mathematical functions. I might or might
not create an actual function stack, we will have to see.

pacman00.c should establish automatic jump scheduling for if-elses
so that crude estimates don't have to be used. This is all it will do.
Honestly, maybe I should make a library with these basic functions
like inst() and ifelse() and add() and multiply().
