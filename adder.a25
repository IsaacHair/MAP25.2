A simple test program to add two 8 bit numbers.
Note: using two's complement, so range is -128 to 127.

Addends are stored at f000 and f001 in ram (lower byte
for each), and the sum is stored at f002 (sum is only
8 bits; the last bit is truncated).

This adder uses mask logic instead of if-else logic.
