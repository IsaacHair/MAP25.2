This just serves as a reference for if I build another computer in the future.

List of things I wish I had included in the map25.2:
	- rotate 8 instruction (swaps upper and lower bytes)
	- ability to just put a sigle byte on the bus from ram
	- more thorough indicators
	- actually wired everything exactly correct
	- addition instruction???????????? <this might not fit the definition of "the most minimal computer"
	- video output scheduler???????????? <might not be minimalist
	- Use nor flash memory instead of eeprom because, even though they are functionally the same
	  on the transistor level, flash memory is way cheaper and comes in parallel packages up to
	  a few gigabytes (and it is considered non-antiquated).

Note that these are tiny complaints and, to be honest, there are always going
to be issues. These just stand out to me the most and are useful to keep in
mind for the future.
