This is just a flow map for the program and a place for me to organize my thoughts.

Current library (bl_1_00.h) includes this shit already:
- lcd boxes of immediate color and immediate or pointer location (but immediate area)
- addition
- multiplication
- extremely rudimentary shit

It looks like a good first step is to create a function that will draw sprites instead of
just boxes. Honestly, the sprite should probably be stored as a segment of ROM, so really
you will have a function to set up the box for the sprite, which calls another function that
is the explicitly defined rom bit basher for each pixel of the sprite. This is the fastest
and most efficient method; you can probably get up to around 10% of the ROM to hold
actual data (the rest will store things like the op code for "imm out0" etc).

Should also create an actual stack finally.

So, both of these ^^ look like things that should go in the basic library, so I will probably
create bl_1_01 and then return to this (lunar_3_01).
