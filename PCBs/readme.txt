These pcbs were created for use on easyeda.com
I am not sponsored by this website, but their pcb designer
is AWESOME.
PCBs were ordered from jlcbcb.com
Again, these guys were just the best.

Note: If you decide to create this yourself, BEWARE:
THERE ARE LOTS OF MISTAKES ON THESE PCBS. See mistakes.txt for a complete
list of changes that must be made during construction.
