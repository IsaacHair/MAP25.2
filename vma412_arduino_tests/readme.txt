need to put all these libraries and maybe more in the "library" folder for arduino:
adafruit_ili9341-master
mcufriend_kbv-2.9.8
VMA412 code and library update


note: this is just some basic diagnostic stuff for me to understand the instruction
protocols on the vma412; once i can write frames to the device, I will stop using
the arduino and start writing a real program on the map25.2


note: actually for the later test files (I think from test file 2 and forward), I just wrote the entire driver based off of the datasheet and using someone's comment code on the arduino website. This stuff requires no libraries.
